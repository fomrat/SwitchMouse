# SwitchMouse (old version was called SwapMouse)
Toggle the mouse's primary button. If it was Left, it'll be Right, and vice-versa.

This began as a console app. Setting it as Output Type: Windows Application means there is neither console nor Window, and thus no flicker.

I use it by putting a shortcut to it on my taskbar, and giving it a shortcut key.

There'll be a lag on first run (a second or two) as the .NET Framework loads. Thereafter, there's a sub-second run time. 

The toggling of the button here is *not* reflected in mouse settings.
