# SwitchMouse (old version was called SwapMouse)
Toggle the mouse's primary button. If Left, will be Right, and vice-versa.

This began as a console app. Setting it as Output Type: Windows Application means there is neither console nor Window, and thus no flicker.

I put a shortcut to it on my taskbar, set it to run minimized, and give it a shortcut key.

There'll be a lag on first run (a second or two) as the .NET Framework loads. Thereafter, there's a sub-second run time. 

The change is not reflected in mouse settings.
