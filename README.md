# SwitchMouse
Toggle the mouse's primary button. If Left, will be Right, and vice-versa.

This is a console app. I put a shortcut to it on my taskbar, set it to run minimized, and give it a shortcut key.

There'll be a lag on first run (a second or two) as the .NET Framework loads. Thereafter, there's a sub-second run time. 

The change is not refelcted in mouse settings.
